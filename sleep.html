        <h1>Sleep</h1>
        <p> 
            This seems like an obvious thing to do when you're bored.
            Not to mention how tiring school and/or work are (especially with those assignments).*

        <h1> Benefits of a Good Night's Rest</h1>
        <p> 
            Most professionals recommend 8 to 10 hours of sleep for teens
            and 7 to 9 hours for adults. I know most of us aren't getting our hours in.
            However, when we have the time, we should take some time to at least get a nap in.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you sleep more, you will get sick less often, which is important because winter is coming.
            The weather is getting colder and I think we can all agree that being warm under
            the covers feels comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, sleep reduces stress and improves mood. That saying that you will
            "sleep it off" is true! But if you continue to dream about stressing out over assignments,
            that's on you. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ **
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, a good night's rest can improve memory as well as concentration on a topic.
            I think it's fair to say that if you're tired, you won't remember much of what happened that day.
        </p>
