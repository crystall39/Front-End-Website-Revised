        <h1>Food</h1>
        <p> 
            It's no surprised the food is delicious. Some people like to snack more than others but
            my statement still stands.
            There are so many choices of food to eat; what will you choose? I've complied
            a short list of favorite food items from classmates. I'll even share a recipe~

        <h1> Food Suggestions</h1>
        <h2> Scrambled Eggs with Ketchup</h2>
        <img class = "shrinked-images" src = "https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/scrambled-eggs-catsup-plate-ketchup-them-140319271.jpg" alt = "Plate of scrambled eggs with ketchup">
        <p> 
            Scrambled eggs are a staple breakfast food. But adding ketchup
            makes it better!* It's a quick and easy dish to make if you know
            the basics of cooking.
        </p>

        <h2> Sicilian-Style Pizza</h2>
        <img class = "shrinked-images" src = "https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/sites/default/files/2020-05/sicilian-style-pizza.jpg" alt = "Sicilian-style pizza">
        <p>
            Sicilian-style pizza is a thick-crusted rectangular pizza.
            It looks very similar to Detroit-style pizza but Sicilian-style
            pizza usually has more sauce on it. From the picture itself,
            wouldn't you say it looks delicious?
        </p>

        <h2> Soup Dumplings</h2>
        <img class = "shrinked-images" src = "https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/GEZZXYV4R5HJVAIMPBULENKI2U.jpg" alt = "A basket of soup dumplings">
        <p>
            Soup dumplings are a type of Chinese steamed buns prepared in a
            small bamboo steaming basket. Inside the bun are seasoned pork
            filling and hot soup.

        <h2> Lava Cake <br />(with a recipe)</h2>
        <img class = "shrinked-images" src = "images/lavaCake.jpg" alt = "Lava cake decorated with a mint leaf">
        <p> 
            If you're a chocolate lover, you must've had at least one lava
            cake before. They're a perfect "fancy" desserts that's not as
            hard to make as you would think. The only difficult part about
            it is the timing.
        </p>
        <h2> 
            I did promise I would include a recipe here. If you've never
            had lava cakes, you can try it now!
