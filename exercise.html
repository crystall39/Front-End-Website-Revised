        <h1>Exercise</h1>
        <p> 
            You're probably sighing right now. Exercise? I want to
            be a couch potato instead!
        </p>
        <p>
            As much as some of us don't like to exercise,
            it doesn't feel that bad after a while. Sure, you
            might feel sore the first couple of days of training
            and it's okay to take a break. But sooner or later,
            you have to get back up again.
        </p>
        <p>
            You've already slept and ate enough, haven't you?
            Time to get up and exercise!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "content">
        <h1> Benefits of Exercise</h1>
        <p> 
            Exercising will help you manage a healthy weight. Whether you want to
            get slimmer or build muscle, it's good for you either way. Some people
            may need to exercise more than others to maintain the same figure, but
            eating healthy foods is also an important factor.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, exercising prevents diseases such as cardiovascular disease
            diabetes, and even some cancers. Regular physical activity lowers blood
            pressure levels and improves cholestrol levels. It also lowers your heart
            rate, which means your heart doesn't have to work as heard to pump blood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, exercise can lead to more restful sleep. This, in turn, boosts
            the immune system and includes all the benefits of sleep (it all comes full
            circle!). It also allows you to sleep more in general because you're more
            tired after exercising and expending your energy.
        </p>
